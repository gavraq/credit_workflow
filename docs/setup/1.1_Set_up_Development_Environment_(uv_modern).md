# 1.1 Set up Development Environment (Recommended Approach)

This document outlines the steps to set up the development environment for this Django project using `uv` for modern Python dependency management.

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13** (see [.python-version](../.python-version))
- **Homebrew** (for macOS)
- **uv** (universal Python package/dependency manager)

## 2. Install `uv`

Install `uv` using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install uv
```

## 3. Initialize the Project with `uv`

From your project root:
```bash
uv init
```
This will:
- Create a `pyproject.toml` for dependency management
- Set up project metadata
- Create a `.venv` virtual environment automatically

## 4. Add Django as a Dependency

Install Django and update your project dependencies:
```bash
uv add django
```
This will:
- Install Django in `.venv`
- Add Django to `pyproject.toml`
- Lock dependencies in `uv.lock`

## 5. Activate the Virtual Environment

Usually you need to activate your virtual enviroment with this command:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
But in this instance, since we are using uv,it automatically detects and uses the projectâ€™s virtual environment (typically .venv) for all its commands, such as uv run, uv pip, and uv add

## 6. Verify Python Version

Ensure you are using Python 3.13 (as specified in [.python-version](../.python-version)):
```bash
python --version
```

## 7. Initialize a Git Repository

If not already done:
```bash
git init
```
Response: Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/gavinslater/credit_risk_system/django_project/.git/

## 8. Add .gitignore file to git
```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore"
```
Response: [main (root-commit) afb2118] Add initial .gitignore file
 1 file changed, 49 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore

## 9. Add Remote Repository on Github
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/gavraq/credit_workflow.git
```
Response: To https://github.com/gavraq/credit_workflow.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/gavraq/credit_workflow.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

Issue: The remote repository has existing content that we need to pull first.

```bash
git pull origin main
```
Response: remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 883 bytes | 220.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/gavraq/credit_workflow
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
 * [new branch]      main       -> origin/main
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint: 
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint: 
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.

Issue: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.


## 10. Configure Git to use rebase for pulling, 
This is generally the preferred method for Django projects:
```bash
git config pull.rebase true
```

## 11. Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup with uv and Django"
git push -u origin main
```
Response: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Delta compression using up to 10 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 591 bytes | 591.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To https://github.com/gavraq/credit_workflow.git
   ae74232..48686e6  main -> main
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.


## Additional Notes

- All dependencies are managed in `pyproject.toml` and locked in `uv.lock`.
- The `.venv` directory is used for your isolated Python environment.
- The [.python-version](../.python-version) file ensures consistent Python version across environments.
- Use `uv` for all future dependency management (e.g., `uv add <package>`, `uv pip ...`).
